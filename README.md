Better MDL is a project i'm working on to enhance the website. I've been using MDL since the very beginning and it hasn't improved that much over the years. So here I am, trying to make the website more friendly and modern!

If you have suggestions, feel free to post them on [this post](https://mydramalist.com/discussions/general-discussion/88611-gathering-feedbacks), just keep in mind that I can't access the API as they don't give keys anymore.

The themes I use in my screenshots are available on my [carrd](https://dear-clouds.carrd.co/#mdl-themes).


## Usage
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser (or you preferred Userscripts Manager)

2. Install my userscript by clicking [here](https://github.com/dear-clouds/better-mdl/raw/main/better-mdl.user.js) and click "Install".

3. Go to [MyDramaList settings page](https://mydramalist.com/account/profile) to customize the script, just like you would to edit your profile (*You will probably need to refresh the page once to see the `Better MDL Settings` section*)

4. For other websites not in the settings, the first time you go on a title page, you will get asked if you want to allow a website on a screen [like this](https://imgur.com/E1eWJJW). Simply allow or forbid the websites you want.

5. Try it out and let me know what you think!
