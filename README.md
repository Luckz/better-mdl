Better MDL is a project i'm working on to enhance the website. I've been using MDL since the very beginning and it hasn't improved that much over the years. So here I am, trying to make the website more friendly and modern!

If you have suggestions, feel free to post them on [this post](https://mydramalist.com/discussions/general-discussion/88611-gathering-feedbacks), just keep in mind that I can't access the API as they don't give keys anymore.

The themes I use in my screenshots are available on my [carrd](https://dear-clouds.carrd.co/#mdl-themes).


## Usage
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser (or you preferred Userscripts Manager)

2. Install my userscript by clicking here.

3. That's it! All customizations & settings are directly accessible via your [settings](https://mydramalist.com/account/profile) on MDL.
