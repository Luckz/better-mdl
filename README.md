Better MDL is a project i'm working on to enhance the website. I've been using MDL since the very beginning and it hasn't improved that much over the years. So here I am, trying to make the website more friendly and modern!

If you have suggestions, feel free to post them on [this post](https://mydramalist.com/discussions/general-discussion/88611-gathering-feedbacks), just keep in mind that I can't access the API as they don't give keys anymore.

The themes I use in my screenshots are available on my [carrd](https://dear-clouds.carrd.co/#mdl-themes) or check my Github profile.


## Usage
1. Install <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a> for your browser (or you preferred Userscripts Manager)

2. Install my userscript by clicking [here](https://github.com/dear-clouds/better-mdl/raw/main/better-mdl.user.js) and click "Install".

3. Go to <a href="https://mydramalist.com/account/profile" target="_blank">MyDramaList settings page</a> to customize the script, just like you would to edit your profile (*You need to scroll down to the end of the page `Better MDL Settings` section*)

4. For other websites not in the settings, the first time you go on a title page, you will get asked if you want to allow a website on a screen <a href="https://imgur.com/E1eWJJW" target="_blank">like this</a>. Simply allow or forbid the websites you want.

5. The first time you're using the Thumbnail View on a page, it might take a little while to load all the posters, especially if there's a lot of titles or if you have slow internet, just be patient.

6. Try it out and let me know what you think!

### Known Bugs

* Some titles won't have the right result for external search. Currently there's nothing I can do as MDL don't refer to those external ids anywhere and scraping can only be that accurate.
